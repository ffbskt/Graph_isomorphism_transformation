I'll help you create a package with a GPLv2 license and set it up with Git. Let's do this step by step.

First, let's check what files we currently have in the workspace:

| üìÅ `.idea` |
| üìÅ `venv` |

</details>

I'll help you create the necessary files for your package. Let's start with creating a README.md and LICENSE file. I'll create them with appropriate content.

First, let's create the README.md:
